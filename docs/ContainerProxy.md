# _Container_proxy

## **Code:** [Vector/ymemory.h](../Vector/ymemory.h#L74)

### Fields:
_MyCont: Pointer to the associated _Container_base12 object, representing the container to 
which the proxy belongs.

_MyfirstIter: Mutable pointer to the first _Iterator_base12 object in the linked list of 
iterators associated with the container.

### Methods:
Inline Default Constructor: Initializes the _Container_proxy object.

Inline Constructor with _Container_base12* _Cont Parameter: Initializes the
    _Container_proxy object with a pointer to the associated container _Cont.

### Functionality:
Connection Management: _Container_proxy manages connections between containers and iterators. 
It stores information about the associated container and maintains a linked list 
of iterators associated with that container.

Iterators Management: The _MyfirstIter field points to the first iterator in the 
linked list of iterators associated with the container. This allows efficient management 
and traversal of iterators associated with the container.

Thread Safety: Operations involving _Container_proxy are performed inline and are 
therefore inherently thread-safe, as they do not involve shared data accessed by 
multiple threads simultaneously.
