# _Container_proxy

## **Code:** [Vector/ymemory.h](Vector/ymemory.h#L74)

The _Container_proxy class serves as a proxy object facilitating the linkage between a container (represented by the _Container_base12 class) and its iterators (represented by the _Iterator_base12 class). It acts as an auxiliary component for managing the iterators of the container.

The primary purpose of _Container_proxy is to efficiently manage the container's iterators in scenarios where the container is moved or copied. For instance, when the container is copied, all iterators associated with the original container need to be reassigned to work with the new container. This process of updating the relationships between iterators and the container is facilitated using the _Container_proxy object.

Additionally, _Container_proxy also provides the capability to break the connections between the container and its iterators (e.g., upon the destruction of the container), thus preventing memory access errors and ensuring proper resource cleanup.

In summary, the _Container_proxy class plays a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of container iterators and ensures their correct interaction with the container in various usage scenarios.
